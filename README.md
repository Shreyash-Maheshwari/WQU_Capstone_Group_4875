# Beyond the Efficient Market Dogma: An Empirical Examination of Market Inefficiencies

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) has long been a cornerstone in financial theory, asserting that markets instantly incorporate all available information, rendering it impossible to consistently outperform the market. However, a growing body of evidence challenges this dogma, suggesting
the presence of persistent market inefficiencies. This study aims to empirically investigate and analyse these alleged inefficiencies, questioning the traditional EMH paradigm and seeking a deeper understanding of factors contributing to market anomalies.
Additionally, the research explores alternative hypotheses such as the Fractal Market Hypothesis and Novelty-Narrative Hypothesis, aiming to assess their validity in explaining observed deviations from market efficiency. By doing so, the study seeks to shed light on the potential for investors to
adapt their trading and investing techniques in response to these market inefficiencies.
